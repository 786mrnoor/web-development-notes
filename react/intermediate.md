## Lifting state up

"Lifting state up" in React is a pattern where the state that needs to be shared between multiple components is moved from a child component to its closest common ancestor component. This ensures a single source of truth for that shared state and facilitates communication and synchronization between components.

## Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?

### Controlled Components:

- Controlled Components are the components whose state and behaviors are managed by React components using states (`value` + `onChange`).

## Uncontrolled Components:

- Uncontrolled Components manage their own state and control their behaviors with the help of DOM.

## Explain React lifecycle methods.

- The React component lifecycle refers to the series of phases that a React component goes through.
- The **hooks** manage component behaviour in functional components.

**There are 3 phases in the React Component LifeCycle:**

1. Mounting Phase
1. Updating Phase
1. Un-Mounting Phase
