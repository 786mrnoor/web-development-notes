## üîπ `GROUP BY` ‚Äì Group rows based on one or more columns

It‚Äôs used **with aggregate functions** (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, etc.) to get results per group.

### üìò Example Table: `Sales`

| SaleID | Product | Quantity | Amount |
| ------ | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| 1      | Apple   | 10       | 100    |
| 2      | Banana  | 5        | 50     |
| 3      | Apple   | 7        | 70     |
| 4      | Banana  | 6        | 60     |
| 5      | Orange  | 8        | 80     |

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Total sales per product

```sql
SELECT Product, SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product;
```

üßæ Output:

| Product | TotalSales |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Apple   | 170        |
| Banana  | 110        |
| Orange  | 80         |

## üîπ `HAVING` ‚Äì Filter grouped results

`HAVING` is like `WHERE`, **but for groups**.

> You **cannot** use aggregate functions in `WHERE`, only in `HAVING`.

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Only products with sales > 100

```sql
SELECT Product, SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product
HAVING SUM(Amount) > 100;
```

üßæ Output:

| Product | TotalSales |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Apple   | 170        |
| Banana  | 110        |

---

## üîÅ `GROUP BY` + `HAVING` + `ORDER BY`

```sql
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQty
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product
HAVING SUM(Quantity) >= 10
ORDER BY TotalQty DESC;
```

## üß† Summary Table

| Clause     | Purpose                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `GROUP BY` | Group rows by one or more columns        |
| `HAVING`   | Filter the grouped rows (with aggregate) |
| `WHERE`    | Filter rows **before** grouping          |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips

* Use `GROUP BY` **before** `HAVING`
* You **can‚Äôt** use `WHERE` with `SUM()`, `AVG()` ‚Äî use `HAVING` instead
