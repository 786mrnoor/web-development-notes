# ðŸ“˜ What is Mongoose?

**Mongoose** is an **Object Data Modeling (ODM)** library for **Node.js** and **MongoDB**.

It provides a **straightforward, schema-based solution** to model your application data. With Mongoose, you can:

* Define **schemas** for your MongoDB collections
* Apply **data validation** and **default values**
* Use **models** to interact with MongoDB documents (CRUD)
* Work with **middleware/hooks** (pre/post save, update, etc.)
* Handle **relationships** and **population** (joining documents)
* Make querying easier with rich **query helpers**

## Why use Mongoose?

* MongoDB is **schema-less**, which is flexible but can lead to inconsistent data.
* Mongoose **enforces schemas** on your data and helps keep it consistent.
* It abstracts away low-level MongoDB driver commands with easy-to-use APIs.
* Supports **built-in type casting**, **validation**, and **business logic**.
* Works great in **Express.js** and other Node.js frameworks.
